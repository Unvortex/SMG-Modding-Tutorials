=== Tutorial #1 ===


[ Modding Setup ]

1. Install Java with "Java Setup.exe" or from the java website: https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp
2. Make sure Super Mario Galaxy 2, or SB4E01, is loaded into Dolphin.
3. Extract the game by right-clicking the game, clicking "Properties" > Click "Filesystem" on the bar above > Right-Click "Disc" > Then Click "Extract Entire Disc"
4. Navigate to your extracted disc and place the DATA folder somewhere that is easily accessible.
	(I recommended making a folder in your 'documents' named something like, "SMG2 Extracted", so your filesystem would be, "C:\Users\USER\Documents\SMG2 Extracted\DATA")
5. Navigate Whitehole to the "files" folder in your DATA partition.
6. It is also recommended that you keep track of which galaxies you edit; maybe in a text file somewhere, since it will make our lives easier when patching through riivoltion.


* If galaxies are not launching in Whitehole, you may need to install JRE7 from the website ... You may also want to try out other Whitehole versions.
Install JRE 7 here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase7-archive-downloads.html


[ To load your edits on Dolphin ]

> After making an edit to a galaxy, make sure you save and run the game by opening "main.dol" in 'DATA > sys > main.dol' through Dolphin
> It is also possible to pack your filesystem into an ISO using Wii Backup Manager, but do NOT redistribute it as it is considered piracy.



[ To load your edits with Riivolution ]

> Create a folder (preferrably on your desktop) and name it the name of your hack/edit.
> Recreate the directory of all changed items; so if you had changed RedBlueExGalaxy, you would create [Name of your mod]/StageData/RedBlueExGalaxy
> Copy the parts of the folder that you have changed, which in most cases would only be the "Map", aka "RedBlueExGalaxyMap.arc"
	* It is recommended you copy instad of just moving it over since you might want to make changes later on.
> Drag that new folder into the riivolution template folder (You can also rename this folder to your mod name)
> Open the XML patch in "riivolution/[TEMPLATE].xml"
> Follow the layout and rename everything that says [TEMPLATE] to the same folder you placed in the template earlier. (This is not case-sensitive to my knowledge)
	* Note that anything that says [TEMPLATE] can be renamed, as well as the actual name of the xml file itself.


[ To pack your edits onto an ISO ]
* This method takes up more storage and is not recommended.

> Download Wiims: https://wit.wiimm.de/download.html#vers-v3.05a
> Once it is installed, open a command prompt and enter "wit", if it says that wit is not an internal command or something like that, you may need to restart your PC.
> Next, type "wit COPY [directory to your DATA folder] -d [Name].iso
	If you have been following this guide closely, it should look something like this: "wit COPY C:\Users\USER\Documents\SMG2 Modding\DATA -d Whatever.iso"
> If you were to place this iso in the directory of where your Wii games are in Dolphin, it would be detected as another "Super Mario Galaxy 2" iso.
